# news-deserts-visualization
Develop a series of data visualizations that measure the change over time of U.S. local news markets. 

*DATA 340 term project*

This repo contains the code that I used to produce the map, waffle plot, bar plot, line plot, and dumbbell plot included in the graphic visualization below,
as well as my data preprocessing steps.

### Datasets
U.S. News Deserts Project (https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/), *UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media*

I obtained this data by submitting a request form, and the project managers sent it to me as a
zip file containing several Excel spreadsheets.
Data included: Database of local newspapers (2004, 2014, 2016, 2020), digital news sites,
public broadcasting (radio), ethnic media

The State of Local News, 2022 (https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-
local-news/), *Northwestern Medill School of Journalism*
The Northwestern project is an expanded report in collaboration with the UNC projectâ€™s
original researchers.

Newspapers Fact Sheet (https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/newspapers/), *Pew Research Center*

In 2020, Pew released research on the state of the newspaper sector. One of the metrics they
tracked from 2005 to 2020 was newspaper employment. Pew defines newsroom employees as
news analysts, reporters and journalists; editors; photographers; and television, video, and film
camera operators and editors. They aggregated employment totals from the Occupational
Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey.

### Visualization packages
Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Pywaffle, seaborn, geopandas, Patchworklib, Plot.ly, Plotnine

### Theme 
I used Adobe Illustrator and InDesign to edit label formatting, copy, and page layout.
